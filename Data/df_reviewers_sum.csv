47,A10ZUMCCLDNPKG,"Dr. Who meets Wild, Wild West. Jules Verne meets The Sting. A short and tantalizing treatment of three mind-blowing ideas. Not much for someone who hasn't read the novels. Not satisfying without the context of the ""Vicious"" novel. This is a plot-driven, pulpy, page-turner. It is a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to teens and adults with a lively sense of fun. Hive minds on Earth; alien surveyors in Space The Final Evolution ...was not the final chapter. The Spanglish-speaking, fractured world was quite the attention-grabber that held together this story collection. The Setting is the Thing. Urban Fantasy - Mystical Steampunk Egypt Reverse Urban Fantasy - Rogue PI Time-manipulation rather than time-travel, but a good story."

Read the entire series Another good read from Andreas Chritensen
91,A11Y2VAR3AWSPX,"A dystopian world short story, that Rob would have been  better off  to leave well enough alone. A prequel that needed a balance of the human side to add heart to its story. Confusion and probing to find out what is in store for Mick. I needed more in this story then a few words at the end. The story-line and plot hold your interest until the next assignment pops up. Nicely written about the GrailChase with the flair of mystical magic and steampunk gadgets. The more disirable strands of the stronger race got lost due to submissive changes for a purpose. A Starfarer tale with a twist. I believe the short story was stopped short of being a great thriller. I think this short story on its face value has a more serious point to express. A  good example of a steampunk sub genre style of  science ficion. Sometimes no matter what you try to do, it just doesn't help anyway One never knows what powers one role plays when it comes to life being threaten."

298,A177QMXBNCEWJB,"space warfare saga at it's finest. Reminiscent of ""Conan"" in knights armour. Magical and disturbing Unmatched horror,fantasy and megalomaniacal magicians. Terrific war story. Pearl Harbor revisited, classic military action. A warning about our current political decisions. A story about individual accomplishment and Big Brother. Stunning prequel (could be) to ""Serenity"" A very interesting and unique story with a convoluted ending. What a terrific series. Military / spy / scifi thriller at it's best. The Martian "" Dodge City "" / O K Corral gunfest. A touch of "" Starship. Troopers"" for the sheer brutality. Another Top-notch space opera. Brutal military scifi thriller Amazing! just like the first installment This wasn't a space opera, this was a soap opera."

A fun twist on classic fairytale tropes I always enjoy Lindsay Buroker's fantasies Prince Not-charming-at-all doesn't realize the others (the actual leads) have such a low opinion of him Another fun, exciting, likable space opera from the Central Galactic Concordance Short but FUN, and perfectly illustrates the characters! As a complete story-arc, 4.0 on Amazon, 3.5 on Goodreads 3 stars Amazon; 2.5 stars Goodreads: just a prologue Just a fun short, ""along the way"" I like Sgt. Yara, the ambivalent new addition to the team, and her PoV. The Kyattese isles prove none-so-peaceful for Rias. A satisfying conclusion. 3.33 stars, for all the collateral casualties, plus ""Part I"" cliffhanger. Another ""I liked it, w/reservations."" Good ending, though."

436,A1AVDYMPBIAMWZ,"Sky Hunter is classic Sci-Fi Foothold. The Story of Mankind's First interstellar colonization by Dennis Ingram is Sci-Fi that has a grasp on reality. Home: Interstellar: Merchant Princess is worth the read. My review of the ""Queen of Arlin"" The Forbidden Army (The League of Planets) by Hennk Rohdin is an entertaining if not exciting Sci-Fi detective story. Naero's Gambit by Mason Elliott is entertaining Sci-Fi which you don't want to stop reading once you begin. Episode #1 - ""Torn"": Star Chasers (Volume 1) was a mystery and it wasn't intended to be one. Naero's Fury by Mason Eliot is ""can't put it down"" Sci-Fi at its best. Naero's Trial: Naero's War is Elliot Mason's best yet in the Naero series. The Seasoning by Dennis Ingram is great Sci-Fi that leaves the reader wanting more. The Gamma Quadrant by Mason Elliot appears to conclude the Naero Mareis series with a happy ending."

As it says on the tin Worth a read, Reynolds fan or not 5 military shorts focused on remote operations of some kind One for a YA audience Great YA read"

969,A1NAM0XHLB1A1T,"Another form of life, another chance at adventure. Not your typical aliens invaded story. Chrisis is an understatement . Continuing the saga of the most horrible things that can happen in war when the aliens have been winning. How is it really possible for the aliens to achieve their goals? Impossible is not a word that exists in this case. War and love in a far distant future. Witches and horrible pirates are possible in this series,not to mention the possibilities of dragons. Survival is the most important thing to achieve in this story. The world of the future will be amazing and very different. So you were wondering about the king and the enemy. Lots of fun for the most unlikely and juvenile heroes and deadly serious problems with pirates. Many new revelations about everything involved in the Dragon Blood stories. Excellent story with many extremely unexpected twists. Answers from the author of this series is in the story and the surprise twists continue. A CONTINUATION OF THE  STORY OF AMII. Continuing the saga of AMII to the END? War is hell and the most horrible things continue to happen. Excellent continuation of this series! Conquest of Earth was a tossup as to who or what would win. Continuing the most horrible and deadly serious problems with many extremely unexpected twists. Another excellent example of the possibilities for power and adventure in the future. Aliens and humans are possibly going through an extremely unexpected battle. Strange and deadly enemies abound in the future."

979,A1NJQ0NZS83SFM,"SciFi on acid...a strange, long trip...but at its core, enthralling. Outstanding adventure! Magnificent read!! Excellent beginning to a series. Book two is available now. Well worth your time. A great new twist in Science Fiction! Excellent new urban fantasy... intriguing. You haven't read this yet?!...Read it NOW. Nasty battles, in nasty conditions, too realistic for the writer not to be intimate with war. A promising first from a new author. Looking forward to book 2. 5 stars is for perfection...this comes close but i've never handed one out. Four stars based on excellent premise and potential! Had i known how much i would enjoy this i would have paid double! I really want to love this book, but i'm finding it hard to read. A great beginning for a long series, ignore the negative reviews! What a thrill ride! Great story! Conflicted, good Sci Fi writing often leaves out the sex scenes for a reason, it can sometimes distracts readers from the story. Excellent. Epic. Well done. It only deserved three and a half, but i don't regret giving it four stars. A great first book for the series...can't wait for book 2. Good potential for a series. Another great book in this series... Ignore reviews that are negative, read this book. This book earned my 4 stars and i will buy the next. I think most fans of his other series will enjoy this, it's a familiar style in a new world and new ability. #7...you have to read it if you've made it this far in the series. Admiral Irons takes a back seat, out with the old and in with the new. For what it's worth...i thought it was both novel and fun. Needs a rewrite to make the story the focus instead of the backstory and history being the primary topic.."

998,A1NWGF0CIVQZGO,"Special forces go head to head with alien elite warriors When you're going through hell, just keep moving... To  expect different results from the same action is insane. When you start with insane anything is possible. Spy vs Spy in a whole new League! Killed by their genetically modified soldiers .Now their spawn want to wipe out humanity. And you think your job is tough... Not up to previous levels Impressive story, heart stopping action. Talk about bait and switch.. You just woke up as some alien's tool. I like the way this guy plays cops and aliens. Just the right touch of mayhem Unlikely and ultimately satisfying adventure. Freedom isn't free, you have to earn it. Cass has paid her dues, can she stay free? Bring em on ! There is no honor among thieves, but damn it gets deep fast. Alien abduction is real, and that's the easy part. I'm glad I bought the series For every winner there are those who have been defeated. The trick is to be on the right side of the equation Not enough stars to properly Rate this book The spirit of his past guides man's future Failure is not an option A swing and a miss One sin I should have skipped"

Good story line Great series Now we are getting very interesting Great story line There is so many possibilities Can the USA survive an unending winter TA Williams has a way of involving you in the ... Good story line Frightening story line I like it Really points to strong communities.
1125,A1RKQJDXZ9QY69,Very good! 4th in series Loved it. Good continuation Good Very very satisfying Good one Great short series Surprisingly satisfying end to the story
1126,A1RL1Q5LPSFZL6,Short but interesting Beautifully Heartbreaking Pure Magic Sweet Fun The pandora principle
1127,A1RLDVADOZD9OA,"Good Series But Needs an Editor Quick, Fun Read Good Short Read Easy Read Great Short Read I don't want this to end! I love these characters Expected More"
1128,A1RLYCQVO9OJ0K,"Keep'm coming As bad as the TV-show scripts it tries to make fun of Enjoyable read Excellent Weird but entertaining As good as the rest in the series Promising start Okay I have quite mixed feelings for this one Very god but... Excellent I did not at all get as much want to read more feeling from this book as from the author's other works Better than the previous Another good one Fun to read but Saxon Andrews books starts to feel a bit mass produced Moon Wreck 1-3: Nice set of short stories A new series and an enjoyable read from Saxon Andrews Moon Wreck 1-3: Nice set of short stories A good ""end game"" to the series Good reading but the ending was a bit si-so Saxon Andrews is back to the same old formula I enjoyed it despite its faults but it could have been so much better This book puts the series back on track Readable but somewhat mediocre Lens of time continues in...another time Good book, better than the previous one Another good read in the Kelly Blake series No marines and not exactly what I expected but a very enjoyable book nonetheless Saxon Andrew continues to write enjoyable light stories Price of Admiralty  Mixed bag, some quite good, some not really my cup of tea Mixed bag again, not sure I will continue reading this series This is my type of book. I really enjoyed it. Not fantastic but a fairly enjoyable space adventure Promising start of  new story arc Good but another permuation of the same formula Good book almost entirely about the marines this time Some faults but not really a bad book I quite like this book series Quite okay little Sci-Fi story Another good book in the series Lots of action, enjoyable reading Good continuation of Democracy's Right Yet another entertaining young adult category book from Saxon Andrew I still like the series although the previous book was a wee bit better Another good book where the humans kick butt instead of being wimps Enjoyable ending to the story arc that started with Wolfhound I am surprised how much I like this book The usual adventure, heroes, bad guys and romance from Saxon Andrew Good book if your preference is combat, combat and more combat Not really my cup of tea More of the same from Saxon Andrew Good conclusion of the serious although a bit tragical. Entertaining but not the best book in the series The start of a new story arc for the Hayden War Cycle Decent reading but as the conclusion of the series it felt a bit bland Fairly average dumb--s politicians vs real fighting men vs alien invaders story More about politics and less about the aliens in this one. Promising title but fairly average reading experience Good reading but another departure from the main story Sounded promising but unfortunately rather meh. For young adults with an emphasize on ""young"" Great military space opera Somewhat lacking Deja vu story Decent enough young adult book The Empire's Corps story continues. As usual an enjoyable book from Chsitopher Nuttall Back to Saxon Adrews usual writing Two Stars Despite being a side story in the series as well as being completely devoid of space action this was a good book Quite nice sci-fi adventure story Very enjoyable fast moving action adventure. Not your usual Sci-Fi, I have to say that I quite liked it! What a load of nonsense! An improvement over the previous book in the series. Quite nice little novella in the Warstrider universe. This series continues to entertain me Not the best but not the worst in the series. A good start for a third story arc in the Ark Royal series Not what I expected but a really good book nonetheless. A quite action filled and well done Empires Corps instalment. Home at last but it is a mixed homecoming. Enjoyable book despite a weird background story Sometimes a bit stupid but fairly enjoyable reading nonetheless The exile and the Terran President is ludicrous, the rest I liked a lot I quite liked it despite the flurry of criminally incompetent officers and politicians. Okay story for the younger readers An excellent read This series is going downhill rather quickly More a teaser than anything else An improvement over the first book in the series A decent enough short-story High-tech fast moving sci-fi adventure The Vigilante continues his high-tech romp through the galaxy Okay adventure story for the younger audience Good book but... Crazy and whacky but fun reading Light, short but fun action story"

1216,A1TY07SJSMMLHS,Had potential that was simply undercut by its short length. An interesting concept with poor execution. An overly mediocre and derivative series. The strongest book in The Fall miniseries thus far. A short light hearted adventure that feels like it could have been a TV episode. An excellent addition to the new Seekers miniseries. A solid old school adventure for fans of the Original Series era.

1341,A1WW0K826FUHEQ,Tufo's second book does not let up A very strong opening to the story A great second book in the series. One of the best Silo authors I believe a better ending that Howie wrote in Dust Simply an Awesome Book 4 to the original Silo Saga A strong second book in the series A very good story set in the Silo-verse Not really a stand alone - but if you have read Earthfall I would recommend The Last Run
1342,A1WYAH2LZVV3G1,"Please get an editor and proofreader! Good story, but needs an editor and profreeding! Interesting story, but the grammar is so bad that I couldn't finish it.

1346,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,"Unique, entertaining and fun, a great story! What goes around comes around! Just as creepy to read as it is to watch the movie! An excellent second book in this series that is full of action, science and Sci-Fi military combat! A good trilogy of books with Sci-Fi adventure that is entertaining! Sci-Fi written for entertainment only and it works! Not as good as I hope it would be! What happens when the baddest man in the universe acquires the power of a god? Three good Sci-Fi books in one set! The apex predator of the planet Earth was about to become the apex predator of the entire galaxy! A good book but not as good as the rest of the series! An excellent set of 3 Sci-Fi books that gave me hours of enjoyable reading! Entertaining and fun! Adam Cain and his team are still the toughest in the galaxy or any other dimension! You and I are the same, the ones who hate war, the sad soldiers! I have a war to wage, against an unbeatable foe, among the unreachable stars! Good military Sci-Fi with a lot of action! The 13th book in an entertaining series of Sci-Fi adventure! A good book and a continuation of the Adam Cain saga! Not anywhere close to as good as the rest of the series! Glory has a high cost and perhaps the loss of love and of a normal life can be a bitter pill to swallow!"

Well written for adventure, personal relationships, and growth of the universe they live in. Exciting and fast-paced concllusion to the Pixie For Hire series. Good story, good characters, good depth of world building. Good continuation of the growth and maturity of April Lewis and her comrades as they build a new culture, independent of earth.

It's just taking a long time to make the point. A good story by an excellent author. Really interesting story.  Will looks for more in series. Enjoyable series 2nd reading even better than the first.  What a great story! Another strong story around our heroine Naero Another interesting Science Fiction Romance Good Series A good start.  An interesting but troubled heroine. Good start to another Spineward Sector storyline More aliens; continuing character development; a good sequel! Good continuation of an interesting story. It was okay and I finished it. Series still good and wanting more Worthy continuation of Cat's story;  but short. Excellent start to a new series. Disappointing.  Early books were better.  Hoping the next one turns this around. Better than the last one; worthy enough to stick around for the next one. Better than the first.  Now vested in seeing the trilogy to its end. a fine continuation of the storyline. Worth the time. Alien cop Knog Beutcher works at cleaning up the planet and sector.  Almost too good to be true but enjoyable. Seriously enjoying this series.  People who you care about and root for. Not my favorite.  Some surprises.  Hope next one is better. A good story with plenty of depth. Another good story in the Adminiral's universe. Solidly into the series.  Still have some complaints but I'm liking Knog more and more. An emotional roller coaster.  Great characters and a great third book until the end.  Disappointed but still recommend series. Very enjoyable. Enjoyable story; but short.  Admiral Kimbridge and her crew keep it interesting. Interesting new female lead but story too short for me Good continuation.  A little bit of everything surrounding the Little Admiral. It was okay.  Least favorite in the series. The adventures keep coming and it's great entertainment.  Excellent series. Interesting collection that may create interest in reading more series. A series which continues to grow and keep me interested. Very good entry in the series. Very well done. Great start to a new series.  Captain Middleton is back! Good continuation of series. Solid story not quite as good as the first. Good story. Third time a charm. Dreck!  Almost agonizing! It was okay.  Vested in the series and I hope I feel better about the next one. So very disappointing!  I'm sorry to say goodbye. A good story.

1659,A25E4FKS7RUMVZ,"In many ways this reminded me of the classic ""Star Trek"" approach... Not literature, but good Military SciFi Even with the editing misses, it was hard to put down. Dark Military Sci-Fi It may have been a little too convenient at times, but didn't get in the way of a good tale. Worth Every Penny! What a diabolical and fun universe to explore! Ringel really shines. If you think Socialism is a good idea; you will hate this book! Not his best work, but a good filler. This is rock-solid Military Sci-Fi! Odd Numbered Star Trek Syndrome Misstitled?? I like the balance of technology and interpersonal relations. A detective story with zombies! This book was less then the sum of its parts. The first act of a three act play... I really expected to not like this book... This is a long way from where the series began. So good that I forgot to eat... A very good, but not great read. What nail-biting drama! Hudner tells a terrific tale; his writing, however, still needs work. Intrigue, drama, and lots of action.  It also has the characters to pull it all together. It's not Ell Donsaii, but it isn't supposed to be... Not much new, but it does a good job of keeping the larger story moving. Good, but not as good as 1-5. I feel like I am missing something... Inconsistent characters, but still a good book. A strong start to a potentially great series. The whole book is rushed, contrived and riddled with errors. Not quite complete but good enough for a fun read. Sara King does ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" in a grand style! Overall another solid entry from Nuttall. It reads like a travelogue from the living room. This book reminded me just how much I liked the series. Two and a half stars. A fun read from a promising author. The strength of this story is the characters A story well told. A pretty good story trying to fight its way out of an editing nightmare."

It's Sci Fi at its best! A well thought out premise with great story telling. Great Stuff!!! Great read!  Frederick Brown is very efficient in writing style, Too short to receive a 5. Great otherwise. Mark Chilton was a master at physiological themed stories. Great concept but a weak lead character Great follow up to Scott Moon's 'Enemy of Man' Typical mega pack, good reading. This book is just as good as the first. Avery strikes again with his indecision over Sheridan PKD II megapack is better than the first. This entire series is a keeper. A-1 in every respect. A writer seeing the future spot on. Great spin on the werewolf theme. Another excellent Sci Fi author from the early days of Sci Fi. All Megapacks are great. Carl Jacobi, 60 years of greatness. F. L. Wallace David H. Keller, early Sci-fi and Horror writer. Lester del Rey, enough said. Charles V. de Vet another sci-fi great. Finally the team wins one, sort of.

1931,A2CSW95FERCW3F,"A strange first contact Well written and brimming with excitement. A truely great read A really intersting series Interesting story of love, space and assaination. Fast paced, truly a page turner I hope the second and thired are as well written A fast paced and exciting read. An interesting read with an unusual end. The book sparks the imagination and reminds us that we will all be strangers when we go to the stars. Good for another zombie story. A truely interesting read Looking forward to the next episode The same team continues forward Imaginative and creative, a true page-turner or in my case, a button-pusher. Mr. Sartison, keep writing on this level of excellence. The story captures and holds your attention all the way to the end. The characters are believable and the story well written. The story really does keep your attention. Someday this could happen to us Though the story is fiction, it is soundly based on fact. I would recommend this novel not only the science fiction reader, but to anyone looking for a good read. I recommend this work to everyone interested in strange scientific fiction reading. The book and the storm have been given the name Frankenstorm engendering a certain excitement. Good for those who like violent reading Liked it very much Interesting reading As in the previous episodes of ""The Hunts,"" the authors imagination makes for a good storyline. I look forward to further issues. Again, this is well written and begins to demonstrate our human capacity to rise up in defense of our way of life. Easy reading and exciting. Exceptionally interesting and a great read. I can strongly recommend each issue as a good read. The reader will probably begin to wonder what great differences there might be if we ever encounter an alien race. If Storm Orphans is an indication of the remainder of the series, I am really going to enjoy reading it all. The story has potential but needs more ""meat."" In Albert Sartison's work, the stories are well written and enjoyable, and this series doesn't disappoint."

1994,A2ED00MI8RZKN2,"John Scalzi just humorously doing what he does so well. These stories continue to enthrall me.  Pure fun with a lot of exiting action thrown in. A pretty standard space opera but the story line and characters were very engaging A very interesting premise.  I enjoyed the story very much. Better than the first one, and it was very good.  I recommend it highly. I enjoyed this book as much as the first one.  Can,t wait for the next one. Mr Dahners has again provided a fun and thought provoking read. A good read with some interesting Sci Fi concepts. Both episodes so far have been excellent reads and I look forward to reading the next one."

Will read more by this author Fantastic lyrical rythm, unusual characters, and vivid descriptions! Do you believe in magic? Speculative fiction with a lovely coming of age slant."
2000,A2EGJQKA3FXKZI,Can chaos be ordered:: perhaps as a side dish A fun and fascinating romp through time and altered history. When I screamed... Great story tremendous world building Tricky tale of Speculative Fiction Nice entertaining short story Could have been a five but for me I couldn't find the Main Character to follow. More great worldbuilding around an endearing character Fantastic fantasy with complex characters and unique style of writing that  brings them to life. Nice read with some grammatical speed-bumps along the way Well paced well developed plot and characters in a superb Military/Political Science Fiction Adventure. Interesting theological sci-fi Nice test drive of a new author well worth the read(beware of soft erotic content) Science dependent and character light -for my tastes it could have been better the other way around. Strange look at a time stopping subject This could be a five star in many ways Refreshing and new view of life and struggle. Humorous thought provoking analogs Great story following a good plot and nice start to a series. Read both books in this set and you won't be disappointed Tall on description but hazy on solid main character Great Fantasy with interesting Protagonist. A three point five that could be much better but is still worth reading
2001,A2EGSV7LMEWX4T,"Awesome first book by new author Great Space Opera April Series, Standout Books Great Story Great Story Great Plot, Weak Science Another Great April Story A whole new level in his writing Another solid hit out of the park in the Spinward Sectors Novels another great story Great story with the feel of a comic book plot Great continuation of the family law series Loved it but where is the rest of it.

Anthology of teasers - some excellent. First contact & mind transfers Great for 10 and under An action sequence from a larger story yet to be told.

Not as good as Lindsay's Emperor's Edge Series If you're a hard-core sci-fi fan who loves space ships and alien encounters, then this book could be your new favourite Can you say cliffhanger? I liked the idea, but loathed the execution of the book. Annoying, whiny brat gets repeatedly saved by the cyborg I wish it was longer I will check out more by Jeff Young.

2062,A2G45Q8V20R779,"A YA Paranormal Romance with lots of appealing characters. Why so few  reviews on this book? Yes, Wolf is like an Otherworldly James Bond, This is becoming one of my favorite series. Mudflat is an interesting place. Discrimination in a  Feudal Asian Feline World I really wanted to love this book. I liked this book better than the first book. 3-3/4 Stars--I liked it! Not bad, for free. I read  Book 1, ""The Catalyst"" first--but I really don't think it matters. Who in the heck names their kid ""Dingus""? Twins, Mages, Mythical Creatures... Pay attention--when this title says ""Dark"" Fantasy, it MEANS Dark. A Nice Mix of Sci-Fi and Paranormal Romance. Anything with Dragons tempts me to read it. Strong Heroine, Interesting World: 3-3/4 Stars Fast Read.  3-1/2 Stars for me. Even the Supernatural World has to deal with Politics and Discrimination. I'd suggest reading at least some of the author's other series before starting this spin-off. This has an interesting plot, but I'm just not fond of the Heroine. I don't believe it's listed as a YA book, but it reads like one. Earth girl is kidnapped, and gets HEA With Hunky Alien. I'm thinking that I'm at a disadvantage ... Sweet and Adult Science fiction Romance Fantasy, quest, mystery, romance.. Lighthearted Urban Fantasy. Nice little supplemental story to Book 1, ""Rex Rising"". Book One of a rather violent YA series. Fascinating and Macabre story. I liked it better than the first book, Ghostly conflicts and tumultuous relationships Good YA Paranormal! Started slow, but really ramped up to a fast, action-filled pace. 3-1/2 Stars--Good Fantasy/Sci-Fi with a strong Heroine. Short, a bit gruesome, and at times unintentionally funny. The series now has an ongoing Villain. I'm actually surprised how much I liked this little YA Fantasy. So, so dark--yet so intriguing Book Two in the Life of Dingus. A small collection of background stories in this fascinating World"
2063,A2G4EEQIKOZF9R,Great! Excellent! Logical and reasonable. Not sure about the way the story was headed. Very good. Excellent story. Not sure yet what its all about. A good one.

Disastrous continuation of Book 3's epilogue; Spoilers. Good time travel novel An enjoyable read Think The Hunger Games meets The Running Man in Jurassic World! A good story, well told A new twist for Tanya with excellent aliens unusual but entertaining A quick, fun read with good 'heroes' and evil villains Good story marred by misuse of English Great start to the series A really exciting continuation"
2241,A2K0H6HYH8WB5F,"Entertaining but missing something Good satire, but won't linger with the reader. Creative, yes.  Great, no. Too adult for some, but a surprisingly well written tale Builds on the strong beginning Rough and forgettable Good Start to a Superhero Storyline More of the onion unfolding Great humor in a fantasy novel Short, but a good tale Readable, but that's about it Fun, but a bit weak The inspiration was obvious More setup than climax. Short, but fun Series no longer with the time Short, Cute, but nothing special Average tale for Niall, too much sex spoils an otherwise good story. Good start to a new series Great twist on the zombie outbreak plotline Hero given too much to make the situation tense Long story that dragged in the end. Too much power, too little character left. When Chris gets away from his ""commonwealth"" he can write decent tales Read a bit too Mary Sue. Seemed soulless Improving series well worth reading What the heck, cats are ""Cute!"" Uninspired tale that fails to become gripping. No good characters, unfocused plot R.J. Ross is growing as a writer Side tale that failed to connect. R.J. got back to what she's good at Typical Niall, too much sex, not enough character I couldn't get into this. Solid tale in a well thought out world. A Transition for the Spellmonger. A great step up for R.J. Good characters, but the reveal for the mystery didn't sing. More space opera than action in space. Good, but lacked a real connection to the reader. Continuing a good series. Just too out there at times Hard to justify continuing to read this series Written by an author who wants to entertain. One of the weaker books in the series, felt like R.J. Ross rushed this one. A tale that doesn't hold up under pressure. This universe needs some world building. Solid sequel with toned down sex. Sailing Ships in Space and it works. My first foray into a genre.  Verdict - puzzled. Disappointing tale of an anti-hero pushed into a new role. Too many characters, too many plots. Plot felt too forced. Another anti-hero, another story that failed to engage me Interesting side story Interesting and imaginative premise saves the day Poor characters left little to like. unusual tale that manages to be fun. Niall's maturing writing shows well If you like his other books, you'll like this. Pretty much unreadable due to poor characters It lacks a good ""hook"" Another addition to the series. Young David's first mission is a success Made me turn pages, but something was missing as well. Superman proxy that doesn't really make the grade I can't figure Kevin out, but he can write goos stories - when he stays focused Overly powerful villians and plot points abound. Weak Story I ended up no caring about the characters. This tale tried to soar to high. Still good, but the characters are growing a bit stale. A good example of a well thought out extension to a series. Started too slow."

Old style classic science fiction to late ""golden age"" Both better and worse than the other books in this collection Solid sequel to book1 if you liked it you'll like this too Perhaps one of worst books I've ever suffered through to the end Not as good as book one 3* only because 2.5* isn't an available choice Too much duplication I didn't ""hate"" this book, but I'm hoping a 1 star review will alert future readers"

Characters that makes no sense, plot points that felt glued on rather than integral... total disaster of a novel Must read and though-provoking anthology of scifi short stories on present and future technology and effect on life and culture Captain ordered to chase down a mutinous ship in league with cyberterrorist found himself caught between duty and honor Too many characters in this debut scifi adventure novel made it confusing to track all the plot Woman arrived on the island and found work at a cafe run by a mysterious chef, what secrets is he hiding?

2606,A2T1V7NNWZALZN,"Slow start but picks up pretty quick. Sci-Fi/Fantasy crossover book and should appeal to readers of both genres. Lightweight Steampunk, needs an editor to sharpen both the characters and the plot development great story, great author Light weight American based Steampunk based on a re-work of her earlier historical western. shades of Anne McCaffery A difficult read but well worth the effort still lots of links to the Anne McCaffery ideas but well worth reading for anyone who loves dragon books While flower magic sounds a bit wishy-washy, these books make it much more interesting and complex, wonderful read You need to be using your Y/A brain when reading this one and you will have a great read I give it 4 stars but if a decent editor got hold of it, it could be like a 10 star book. Readable but nowhere near as good as the author's other books Well written series by a great author, highly recommended reading Nice introduction for the characters and world but not much overall plot. Lots of action, political intrigue and a strong plot. Great for anyone who loves sailing adventures whether on water or in space If you can put up with the word ""shouting"" on every page and forget that this was supposed to be edited you migh enjoy it. Ho Hum Steampunk, not as good as the first book in the series, hoping for much more in the next one. Excellent series, nicely rounded out ending. Highly recommended reading. strong continuance of this great series, highly recommended reading for fantasy/adventure readers."

Very good adventure Good, suspenseful novella Dave Freer has written better novels. This isn't bad, but it's not his best. Easy reading, enjoyable space opera adventure. Exactly what it says it is: Book 5.5 in a 7-book series (6 will be out soon). Reliable entertainment! A very good, hard-to-put-down read in the Balanced on a Blade's Edge universe. Enjoy it! Very nice steampunk homage to Holmes/Watson Couldn't finish.  Too derivative. Meh, not for me. Maybe someone else would like it. Not quite steam punk, not quite science fiction, a bit of romance, very enjoyable Good plot, but needs both better copy editing & science editing It's a decent space opera, but not particularly exceptional"

Good book, good series. Still a good series, but more obviously a series of ""short pieces"" instead of a arc of full stories.

More realistic than you realize (not the FTL part, but everything else) incompetent elves chase each other finally an author breaks the mold formula Mandrake, or Lionsdrake ... pitiful heroes, interesting concept, should be about farmer & female guard Starship scale cave exploring for lost alien treasure I find it believable, if pedantic, and a great story unrequited potential (review of first 3 novels) This is a good series and I love the characters and a great entertainment, part detective story less than expected from this writer slice of life with Indian tribes on cat-world swashbuckling planetary adventury Silliness punctuated by inept drama Great beginning with the rescue-escape scene Demolition girl seduced by horny, sheltered king almost aware human trafficking in space city good sequel superwoman-queen-goddess gradually revealed while everyone gets killed Five Stars Horrible disappointment. the Confederacy rides again Four Stars Classic Mandrake Company. Maybe the series is kind of ... Daems does female misfit combatants very well. Over and ... mild diversion with mythological plots given a pseudo-SF context slow with unbelievable characters and self-spoilers too much repetitive fighting Three Stars intriguing with a few plot flaws it looks like it sets up sequels which cannot be anything but excellence rises to the top, but will it be selected? Attempt at planetary adventure doesn't click yet, but has potential Worth reading if you like the series documentary style Oedipus story with techno-effects tour de force assault on fallacies of 21st century culture (and a good story to boot!) skip the first half Unusual at first but becomes predictable not as good as Emperor's Daughter Another subtle hero follows his principles and his heart, and manages to thread the needle The gem of an unwritten idea, and the denigration of Pellucidar surprised to find this one of Daems' best Five Stars Naive wish fulfillment, not as good as first book where did the magic go?  question answered . . . Good series, forgettable entry good writing spoiled by conceptual and character problems interesting concept but dryly narrated not as good as first two very clever slow build, some pros and cons but great ending Four Stars"

Great Second Book to the series Reads a bit like a kids SCI-FI book. A potentially good series Loved the book but getting a bit silly. A very enjoyable read. Could have been much better with more background detail. A good book but probably where I will stop. A good continuation Wish I'd have waited for mass market pricing.... Glad to see the first three in an omnibus The story picks up nicely from where Bright Horizons left off It was an enjoyable book Great Trio of Military style SCI-Fi without being overly rigid. An interesting story line. A series that stays enjoyable. Short, enjoyable story a nice read A short, enjoyable first book A good read for free A fun romp through a new unknown An exciting start to a series Love the premise but tough getting through some of the drivel The story was good, the packaging not so good. A very enjoyable book A gritty first book to a new series Simplistic Sci-Fi geared towards a younger audience. It's a cute book An ok space Harlequin storyline. A very good continuation of the story A 'young adult' or older teen book Enjoyable first book I've read from this author Enjoyable read. A good introductory short story. A nice first book.

4338,A9GMT575AQ9A9,"The unclothed woman on the cover is misleading. Another lesbian romance I got the novel for free, but it was such a great read I had no choice but to buy the next three sequels. A novel for engineers not for English majors Ken is an exciting writer and his science will not embarrass you. Lesbian adventure Too much for too little A fun, quick read. Well worth $3.99 for the download. A super hero book for those who don't like super hero books. Enjoyable and inspiring Probably good juvenile science fiction. Chris Hechtl is one of my favorite authors and this was another great story. I loved this sequel. Well written sci-fi, action adventure novel. I downloaded the sample and I knew I would be buying the novel a couple of minutes into it. An excellent sequel. Very complex science fiction.  Not for a non-geek I am really looking forward to the sequel. Good young adult or juvenile novel Very much like the Riss series. Just a fun novel to read. Another wonderful book by Dahners. One of the top space warfare novels I have read. Great novel!  Don't miss the first two novels in the series. This is a fun book to read for youth or even an old Sci-Fi reader. Feels good to take a vacation from intense, gloom and doom science fiction. I enjoyed the sequel and looking forward to the next. Very good Science Fiction. This is a very quick read, but I really enjoyed it. I really enjoyed reading this novel. Great sequel, but read book one first. Enjoyable but quick read. The book is a fun read. Not very interesting I almost liked it. The story would be more enjoyable to a young adult audience. A younger person might enjoy it. Paul Philips writing just keeps getting better each book. Better writing than the America One series. I love books where the main character is an engineer. This is a very good novel of the space warfare genre."

Fun book, easy to read A thoroughly enjoyable read! Another excellent book in this series I really like this series and this story but the editing is horrible Interesting story, terrible editing - makes it somewhat frustrating to read (although I did purchase the next in the series) Very entertaining but not the best book in the series. Don't purchase this book as the gratutious sex detracts from an otherwise decent story Entertaining, interesting and action packed. Great plot, very poor editing Great story, exciting new author (for me), outstanding potential - beware of the the editing Wonderful story, great action, high recommended. Delightful reading and very fast paced; always somethng happening Interesting story, fun to read.  Great installment in the series. Great start - please hurry with the next one! I certainly hope that there is a sequel - very enjoyable book Great book to end the series and I hope there is a spinoff; could use better editing. Some of the best money I ever spent - very enjoyable book Excellent second book in the series.  Get yours now. Another great book in a great series. Maybe the best book Mr. McGinnis has written.  Lots of fun to read This series continues to get better and better. This is one of the best in the series. Mr. Ward, thank you for a great book! I just couldn't put this one down.  Read it in a day Wonderful book with many different plots Interesting and exciting story. Read it in one sitting - it is that good Great expansion of previous characters and  wonderful introductions of a new character; all wrapped in a fantastic story Wonderful books; I hope that we get more of these Great book - please put a rush on the next one! Another homerun for Ruby!!!  Fabulous story, interesting surprises. Good reading for a rainy day! Great Sadness, great joy - another fine book in the series. This is my favorite ""Alamo"" story yet. I am very eager for the next one. Maybe the best book in the series - great characters and lots of action All in all, a good, solid collection of stories Great addition to the series Wonderful story with many new worlds and races added to ... Good story, interesting characters but poor editing Hard, gritty story with lots of action and an unusual storyline Read it in one day.  The story ""The Hunted"" is one of the best short stories ever."

Will try to finish it later-maybe... Clever & very different than other old military apocalypse books- there are NO guns here! Felt like a political book Trilogy review with no spoilers. Great read & why... I have no knowledge of ships or the words they use... there is nothing that sets it apart or makes it special- from others like this. The first 1/3 of the book introduces ... A good twist on time travel. Surprize ending. Great read. Review of series with no spollers. Each book only about 60 pages! Review of first 3 books with no spoilers. Great read but only 60 pages each! A great story with many differnt elements to it. Not just zombie, monster stuff. Why all the short 60 page books?  Great read. A very good read, but only 60 pages in each book!"

4622,AG3D4EWE8N2P4,"Good, solid start to a long series. Short but satisfying, and worth the price. Worth it? Good premise, but only so-so execution. A good,satisfying,believable, quick read that neither bogs down in too much detail or relies on stick figure characters An unsatisfying ""nibble"" when I wanted a full meal ""Fey"" was well done but I liked its prequel, ""StarFire"", a lot better. One of Nuttall's weaker works Too much technical detail, not enough character development, main discovery not convincing. OK, but not as good as Tackett's similar ""A Distant Eden"" series Fairly well done, but has a major hole in its plot Very good military science fiction, and getting more interesting with each volume. Constant sex scenes cannot make up for a mediocre science fiction story An attempt at an E.E. ""Doc"" Smith type Space Opera that just didn't work. Well done, but pretty predictable, and just OK as compared to his Empire's Corps series Excellent action and story telling, and looking for more Good, but Cherryh's ""Foreigner"" series better. A lot better than average, and leaves you wanting more OK but not as good as the first volume, needs editing Good, exciting, plausible story featuring Nuttall's usual good writing. Too much James Bond. Great space opera with the odd word choice or two thrown in. Even more exciting than volume one, still some pretty gruesome images. Well done, and reminds me of the less hard-edged SF of the 50s--and that's a good thing. A repetitive plot, this time further undermined by growing numbers of word choice and spelling errors. A well-written, interesting, and exciting series that keeps you wanting more."
